## Elixir Starter Toolbox 

One of my favorite parts about programming Elixir is the amount of tools that you can use and implement for have a 
better environment for code. 

Since you can run a `script` or open an `iEX` repl and try elixir, there are some tools that I found useful for any beginner.

## Code Editor

There are many good options for choose as `Code Editor`, I recommend spend some time choosing the best option based on the capabilities that this editor is giving to you for code, some of the most popular have good plugins:

### Visual Studio Code

Maybe this is one of the most popular editors right now, you can install extensions for highlights ([VS Code Elixir](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mjmcloug.vscode-elixir)), code completion and debugger ([Elixir LS](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JakeBecker.elixir-ls)), open an `iEX`([iEX](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mbakerpdx.iex)) or run tests ([Elixir Test](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=samuel-pordeus.elixir-test)).

### Sublime Text

You can install plugins using the `Package Control`, there are packages for highlighting ([Elixir](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Elixir)), or just for run the formatter ([Elixir Formatter](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/ElixirFormatter)).

### VIM

You can open any elixir file, but if you want to set the syntax hightlights without a plugin, you can type `:set syntax=ruby` and the editor will render the file with highlights.  Also you can install plugins for the code highlights ([Vim Elixir](https://vimawesome.com/plugin/vim-elixir-sparks-fly)), implement mix commans ([Mix-Vim](https://vimawesome.com/plugin/mix-vim)), or just run the mix formatter ([Vim Mix Format](https://vimawesome.com/plugin/vim-mix-format)). Additionally you can use [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) for have a complete setup in your favorite terminal.
